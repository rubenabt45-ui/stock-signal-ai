# Performance Optimizations Report

## Bundle Analysis
- Bundle report generated at `dist/bundle-report.html` after production build
- Run `npm run build` to generate the visualization

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- ✅ All route components now lazy-loaded with React.lazy()
- ✅ Vendor chunks split: react, supabase, UI libs, charts, i18n
- ✅ StripeTestRunner only loads when needed in dev mode
- ✅ TradingView scripts load on-demand with preconnect

### 2. Bundle Optimization
- ✅ Aggressive minification enabled (Terser)
- ✅ Tree-shaking enabled
- ✅ Console/debugger dropped in production
- ✅ Source maps disabled for production
- ✅ Modern ES2020+ build target

### 3. Network Optimizations
- ✅ DNS prefetch for TradingView and Stripe
- ✅ Preconnect for Google Fonts and external APIs
- ✅ Font-display: swap for non-blocking font loading
- ✅ CSS code splitting enabled

### 4. Runtime Optimizations
- ✅ Performance metrics logging (TTFB, FCP, LCP)
- ✅ Debounced TradingView widget loading
- ✅ Cleanup timeouts to prevent memory leaks
- ✅ Lazy component loading with proper fallbacks

### 5. Asset Optimizations
- ✅ Immutable chunk hashing for cache optimization
- ✅ Gzip/Brotli compression support
- ✅ Font subsetting with Google Fonts API

## Expected Results
- **Bundle Size**: 30%+ reduction in initial JS payload
- **Loading Speed**: 20%+ improvement in FCP/LCP
- **Caching**: Better long-term caching with chunk splitting

## How to Keep It Fast
1. Always use React.lazy() for new route components
2. Import icons individually: `import { Icon } from 'lucide-react'`
3. Use dynamic imports for heavy libraries
4. Monitor bundle size with the visualizer plugin
5. Keep VITE_ENABLE_STRIPE_TEST=false in production
6. Use Suspense boundaries for better UX during loading
7. Debounce expensive operations (API calls, chart updates)
